## GoIT Node.js Course Template Homework

##### [ [PL](./readme.md) | [EN](./readme.en.md) ]

Please fork this repository to complete your homework assignments (2-6).
Forking will create a repository on your http://github.com account.

Add a mentor as a collaborator.

For each homework, create a new branch.

- hw02
- hw03
- hw04
- hw05
- hw06

Each new branch for a task should be created from the `master` branch.

Once you have completed your homework on your branch, you should make a pull request (PR). Then add a mentor to your code review. Only after the PR is approved by the mentor can you merge the homework branch into the `master` branch.

Read your mentor's comments carefully. Correct your comments and commit to the homework branch. The changes will automatically appear in PR after submitting a commit with corrections to GitHub. After corrections, add the mentor back to the code review.

- When completing your homework, provide a link to the PR.
- The JS code is readable and understandable, `Prettier` is used for formatting.

### Commands:

- `npm start` &ndash; starts the server in production mode;
- `npm run start:dev` &ndash; starts the server in development mode;
- `npm run lint` &ndash; runs code checking with `ESLint`, should be performed before each PR and correct all `linter` errors;
- `npm lint:fix` &ndash; same as above, but also automatically corrects simple errors.
